ESTATE PLANNING OVERVIEW

**PROBATE** is the process of distributing assets following death of a Person who dies with a WILL or dies without a WILL.

PROBATE Court proceeding when a person's estate is administered and assets are distributed, all under Probate Court supervision. PROBATE proceedings are open to the Public.

PROBATE begins with the granting of legal authority by the Probate Court to your designated administrator (Executor/Personal Representative) to take control of your assets following your death, to find and pay valid creditors and to distribute your assets to the beneficiaries named in your WILL.

A separate PROBATE is often required in each state where real property is owned.

PROBATE generally requires hiring an attorney.

PROBATE**_Can be costly_**_._ Estate administration can cost 5% to 8% or more of the value of the assets in the estate.

PROBATE**_Can be lengthy_**_._ Estate administration can last nine (9) months to one year or longer.

ESTATE TAXES Any tax which is charged to the Estate as a whole, as compared with a tax charged to the recipients of the assets distributed from an Estate. Estate Taxes exist in the Federal Tax Codes and in some State Tax Codes. A Married Couple can effectively double the Federal Estate Tax Exemption by the use of A-B TRUSTS.

I WHAT HAPPENS TO MY PROPERTY, WITH OR WITHOUT A WILL?

Introduction

If the decedent had a Will, the Court orders distribution of property comprising the decedent's probate estate under the terms of the Will. If there is no Will, the property is distributed according to state law. (A person who dies without leaving a Will is said to have died "intestate". A person who makes a Will is called the "Testator" (male) or "Testatrix" (female) and is said to have died "testate."

What is included in the probate estate? All property the decedent owned in his or her own name, plus any and all other property interests that do not pass to somebody else by operation of state law. This does not include any property held in a Tenancy by the Entireties or as Joint Tenant with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS). The decedent's assets for Federal "Estate Tax" include all of the probate estate and several other assets not probated, such as a portion of JTWROS property and the proceeds of life insurance policies owned by the decedent.

DO I NEED A WILL?

Your Will allows you to give the Court instructions on several critical matters: (1) Who gets your property, (2) Who is in charge of making the distribution, and (3) Who you want to be named guardian of any minor children.

The following is an example of the Florida Probate Law. While each State may have a slightly different law, for purposes of example, the differences are minor.

What happens if you die without a Will while you are a Florida resident and are:

Florida law provides for an allowance to be set aside for the surviving spouse and/or children whether there is a Will or not. This is free from any claims against the estate or debts of the decedent. These survivors take up to $18,000.00 "off the top" of the estate, before the creditors, heirs and beneficiaries line up to receive their shares of what remains, under the Will (if there is one) or the state law of intestate distribution (if there is no Will). If there is no Will, Florida law also gives the surviving spouse an interest in any homestead real estate owned by the decedent.

Married with children? Many people falsely believe that the surviving spouse/parent would take all the deceased spouse's property. That is not always the case. If the decedent and the surviving spouse had no children outside this marriage, the law awards all of the decedent's property to the surviving spouse. If the decedent had any children by another person, not the surviving spouse, or the surviving spouse had any children by another person not the decedent, the surviving spouse only receives one-half the estate and the children of the decedent receive the remaining half.

Married with no children? The intestate decedent's surviving spouse would take all.

Single person with children? When a single person with children dies without a Will, the entire estate is divided evenly among the children.

Single person with no children? In this situation, the decedent's parent(s), or the survivor of them, receive the entire estate. If both parents are deceased, the decedent's brothers and sisters divide the estate, with the share of any deceased sibling divided among that sibling's children.

If there is a Will written before a marriage, the surviving spouse can, under some circumstances, take a share of the estate just as if there had been no will.

If there is a Will, and a child is born after the Will was written, that child may take a share just as if there was no Will.

If there is a Will, the surviving spouse can renounce it and the inheritance it contains (if any), and instead take what's called an "elective share". This is a legal device originally intended for the protection of the wife. Historically, all of a family's property might be titled solely in the husband's name. The "elective share" protects a woman (or man) against being "written out" of a spouse's Will. This may be a matter of some concern when a couple has married later in life, both bringing property and existing children to the second marriage.

For example, a husband might have investments and other property in his name alone, and write a Will directing all of it to his children by a previous marriage. The wife could petition the probate court to take her "elective share" or 30% of the estate under the law. The 30% does not include any amount the spouse might receive as family allowance, homestead property, and any exempt personal property, which the surviving spouse also takes.

If there are minor children, a Will should always be used to name a guardian(s) of the minor children and property. Alternates should also be named. While the Court is not bound by this declaration, it does carry great weight. The purpose of the Will in this regard, though, is to guide the court, and to avoid family arguments over who is better qualified.

Many of these concerns can be addressed by signing a prenuptial agreement or postnuptial agreement, by creating a Living Trust, or a combination of the two.

If you don't fall into any of the categories above, there are further instructions in the law to decide who gets your property. If **_YOU _**want to decide who gets your property, **you need**, at minimum, **a Will**.

THE SIMPLE WILL.

This is what most married couples first think of. Each spouse's Will is a "mirror image" of the other. The entire estate is left to the surviving spouse and at the death of both the estate is divided among the children or named heirs.

This kind of Will provides as follows:

Payment of debts and taxes.

Enables use of a "Separate Writing" to dispose of items of tangible personal property, you create your own list to specify that certain items be left to a specific individual. You can amend this list at any time without revisiting an Attorney.

Disposition of the remainder (the "residue") of property.

This consists of everything that remains after steps 1 through 2, above. Usually, people want it this way: "If I die first, everything goes to my spouse. If my spouse has already died, all to the children, in equal shares, per stirpes." (Latin for, "If a child dies before the parent, that child's children split the share.") The Wills are mirrorimages of each other.

Naming of a Personal Representative usually the spouse, but there should be an alternate, too. The Will also usually waives posting of a bond by the Personal Representative.

Specifying the powers of the Personal Representative, including a specific mention of whether the Personal Representative may sell real estate without Court approval.

WILL REQUIREMENTS.

To qualify as a Will, it must appear to the court looking only at the document itself that it was intended to be the final expression of the Testator's wishes as to the disposition of his property to take effect upon death. That is why a general letter stating one's desires, or a list of property with beneficiaries' names usually is insufficient. For ease of explanation, the male gender is used in these explanations. A female who makes a Will is a Testatrix.

Most importantly, the Will maker must have "testamentary capacity." This requires that the Testator be of "sound mind," which might be a misleading term. He must only be aware of the nature and extent of his property; must know who are the "natural objects of his bounty," i.e., his family, and the Testator must be aware that by signing the Will, he is making a final disposition of his property.

The Will must be properly executed. This means that the Will must be signed in the presence of at least two witnesses, who must sign in the presence of the Testator and each other. Most Attorneys will have the Testator and witnesses sign a selfproving affidavit attached to the end of the Will, in the presence of a Notary Public. This self-proving affidavit can eliminate the necessity of producing witnesses when the Will is probated.

Many States do not recognize what is called a Holographic Will, in which the significant portions are written in the handwriting of the Testator and is signed but not witnessed. 

Codicils are amendments to an earlier Will. No written additions or changes should ever be made on the original document, however. Instead, a separate page can be prepared, referring specifically to the original Will, and executed with the same formalities required of a Will. In most cases, it is simpler and no more expensive to just start from scratch and do another Will. (Remember to destroy the old one to avoid any confusion.)

II THE PROBATE PROCESS

Probate is a court proceeding.

The probate procedure involves three basic steps.

The selection and duties of the Personal Representative.

More facts about Wills and Probate.

PROBATE IS A COURT PROCEEDING.

It is here that final debts are settled, and legal title to property is formally passed from the decedent to his/her heirs. Probate occurs in the county of the decedent's legal residence at death. Usually, the first step is taken by the person named as Personal Representative, or other interested person who has the original Will.

The custodian of the Will is required to file the original Will with the Clerk of the Court after a person dies. They should also file a certified copy of the Death Certificate at the same time. The nominated Personal Representative should file a Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative. If there is no Will, somebody must come forward and ask the court to be appointed as Personal Representative. Probate law provides for certain persons to have priority in being appointed, with the person nominated in the Will receiving the highest priority.

The "probate estate" simply refers to any property subject to the authority of the probate court. Assets disposed of outside the probate process are part of the "nonprobate estate."

Probate is conducted by the Court in and for the County in which the decedent resided. If the Estate subject to administration is small, there is a streamlined procedure that can save time and legal fees.
